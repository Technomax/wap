                        <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
                        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.
                        </p>
                        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the
                            tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
                                title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
                        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
                            Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating
                            fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

                        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                            encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking
                            on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
                                title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has
                            changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
                        </p>
                        <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the
                            style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
                            people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the
                            hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                            contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

                        <h3>Requirements</h3>
                        <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to
                            widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden
                            is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the
                            latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement
                            we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you
                            should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of
                            user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212;
                            pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do
                            test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
                            Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
